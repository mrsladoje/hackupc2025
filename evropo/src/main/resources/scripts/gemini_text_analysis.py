### Explanation of Each Metric

#### `analysis.mentions_protest`

* Return `true` if the article directly references a protest or demonstration.
* Return `false` if no protest is mentioned.

#### `analysis.protest_info.organizer`

* Name the individual(s), student group, political group, or organization responsible for organizing the protest. If not mentioned, use "unknown".

#### `analysis.protest_info.date`

#### `analysis.protest_info.location`

* Provide the geographical location where the protest took place. If not mentioned, use "unknown".

#### `analysis.protest_info.count.government`

* Extract the **estimated number of people** attending the protest *as reported by government or pro-government sources*.
* Return the number as an integer if found.
* Return `null` if no such estimate from a government source is mentioned in the text.

#### `analysis.protest_info.count.independent`

* Extract the **estimated number of people** attending the protest *as reported by independent sources* (e.g., organizers, independent media, observers).
* Return the number as an integer if found.
* Return `null` if no such estimate from an independent source is mentioned in the text.

#### `source`

  * 0 = No government narrative present
  * 5 = Strongly biased in favor of government or hostile toward protests

#### `pro_student_messaging`

* Score from 0 to 5 indicating how much the article supports or sympathizes with student protesters:

  * 0 = Hostile or dismissive toward students
  * 5 = Strong support for the student cause or sympathetic portrayal

#### `student_mentions.good_count`

* Number of times students are portrayed **positively** (e.g., brave, organized, peaceful, idealistic)

### Input Text

You will receive a news article as raw text. Your task is to read and analyze it thoroughly and then return the JSON structure above with accurate values and scores based *only* on the provided text. If a piece of information is not present in the text, use "unknown" for strings or `null` for numbers where specified.

Text to analyse: "{text_to_analyze}"

Always escape quotations in strings and ensure the output is valid JSON. Only output the JSON object, without any introductory text or markdown formatting like ```json.
